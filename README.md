# LibraTrack

A command-line library management system written in C++17.

LibraTrack handles book cataloguing, member management, loan tracking, fine calculation, search, and reporting. The codebase is deliberately small enough to navigate in a single session, but large enough to feel like a real multi-module project.

## Quick Start

**Linux / macOS / WSL:**
```bash
# 1. One-time setup — configures and builds everything
./setup.sh

# 2. After fixing a bug, check your work instantly
./check.sh <issue-number>
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# 1.
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned

# 2. One-time setup
.\setup.ps1

# 3. After fixing a bug
.\check.ps1 <issue-number>
```

Examples:
```bash
./check.sh 1    # runs the test for Issue #01
./check.sh 42   # runs the test for Issue #42
```

`check.sh` / `check.ps1` rebuilds your code, runs the associated public test, and prints a clear **PASSED** or **FAILED** result with the exact assertion output so you know what to fix.

Requires CMake ≥ 3.16 and a C++17-capable compiler (GCC 9+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+).
